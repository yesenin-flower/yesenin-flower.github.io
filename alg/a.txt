I once interned at Baidu Data Research and Development Department, and our team focused on Knowledge Graph and Question Answering System. Although I was competent on programing with four years of course training, Nature Language Processing was a whole new field to me. The task was to replenish and update knowledge base from unstructured corpus based on existing SPO(subject-predicate-object) triples. Since internet data can’t reflect the correct relation or have many inaccurate entities, sentences need to be filtered by training a classifier. I spent lots of time on review literature on the topic of knowledge graph and relation extraction. Then, I prepared deliverables and presented it to the team. After several rounds of tense discussion, project manager agreed on my project proposal. I put the ideas into lines of codes: distant supervision was used to label sentences in a large corpus using their lexical features, grammatical features and position features. Potential entities are extracted and evaluated to rank their confidence. My performance was appraised and the intern was successful illustrating by a job offer from the manager. This intern ignites my interest in NLP. Most importantly, it teaches me how to tackle a real world task by building upon existing knowledge.
